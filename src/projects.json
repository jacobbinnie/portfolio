      "description": "An original addictive online game I built in a similar game format to Wordle. Each day there's a new clue that appears on screen, it's the users job to guess the word in only five attempts. The game saves a user's track score locally and is responsive for all devices. With over a years worth of puzzles coded in and active players around the world, I'm fairly proud of this one. The app was built entirely using react.js & vanilla js.",

Built entirely using react.js & vanilla js, this portfolio was designed to achieve three core things. One, demonstrate clean frontend UI design. Two, demonstrate vanilla js interactiveness and provide a list of all proficient skills. Three, collate some of my favourite frontend projects I've worked on in one easy place. Feel free to check out the Github repo below.",

<h1>Portfolio | Jacob Binnie</h1>

<p>I designed this portfolio with a very minimalistic idea in mind. Previously, many of my portfolios had been littered with details, project specs, unnecessary data and excessive animations to attempt to&nbsp;<em>impress&nbsp;</em>viewers. The core idea for this portfolio was to&nbsp;<em>demonstrate&nbsp;</em>clean UI design with vanilla javascript interactiveness. As the user hovers their mouse over the card, the card responds in 3D movement. The entire project was built using react.js + vanilla javascript for 3D animations. Sometimes less is more.</p>

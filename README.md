<h1>Portfolio | Jacob Binnie</h1>

<p>Built entirely using react.js &amp; vanilla js, this portfolio was designed to achieve three core things. One, demonstrate clean frontend UI design. Two, demonstrate vanilla js interactiveness and provide a list of all proficient skills. Three, collate some of my favourite frontend projects I&#39;ve worked on in one easy place. Feel free to check out the Github repo below.</p>
